<p ><a class="el" href="a04100.html">ImuFactor</a> is a 5-ways factor involving previous state (pose and velocity of the vehicle at previous time step), current state (pose and velocity at current time step), and the bias estimate.</p>

<p ><a class="el" href="a04060.html">CombinedImuFactor</a> is a 6-ways factor involving previous state (pose and velocity of the vehicle, as well as bias at previous time step), and current state (pose, velocity, bias at current time step).</p>
<p >The measurements are then used to build the <a class="el" href="a04060.html">CombinedImuFactor</a>. Integration is done incrementally (ideally, one integrates the measurement as soon as it is received from the IMU) so as to avoid costly integration at time of factor construction.</p>
<p >Following the pre- integration scheme proposed in [2], the <a class="el" href="a04060.html">CombinedImuFactor</a> includes many IMU measurements, which are "summarized" using the <a class="el" href="a04056.html">PreintegratedCombinedMeasurements</a> class. There are 3 main differences wrpt the <a class="el" href="a04100.html">ImuFactor</a> class: 1) The factor is 6-ways, meaning that it also involves both biases (previous and current time step).Therefore, the factor internally imposes the biases to be slowly varying; in particular, the matrices "biasAccCovariance" and "biasOmegaCovariance" described the random walk that models bias evolution. 2) The preintegration covariance takes into account the noise in the bias estimate used for integration. 3) The covariance matrix of the <a class="el" href="a04056.html">PreintegratedCombinedMeasurements</a> preserves the correlation between the bias uncertainty and the preintegrated measurements uncertainty.</p>

<p >Following the preintegration scheme proposed in [2], the <a class="el" href="a04100.html">ImuFactor</a> includes many IMU measurements, which are "summarized" using the PreintegratedIMUMeasurements class. Note that this factor does not model "temporal consistency" of the biases (which are usually slowly varying quantities), which is up to the caller.

<p>This factor estimates the body pose, body-camera transform, 3D landmark, and calibration.</p>
<p >The calibration is known here. This version takes rolling shutter information into account as follows: consider two consecutive poses A and B, and a Point2 measurement taken starting at time A using a rolling shutter camera. Pose A has timestamp t_A, and Pose B has timestamp t_B. The Point2 measurement has timestamp t_p (with t_A &lt;= t_p &lt;= t_B) corresponding to the time of exposure of the row of the image the pixel belongs to. Let us define the alpha = (t_p - t_A) / (t_B - t_A), we will use the pose interpolated between A and B by the alpha to project the corresponding landmark to Point2.</p>
<p >The factor requires that values contain (for each pixel observation) two consecutive camera poses from which the pixel observation pose can be interpolated.</p>
<p >Each camera may have its own extrinsic calibration or the same calibration can be shared by multiple cameras. This factor requires that values contain the involved poses and extrinsics (both are <a class="el" href="a03288.html">Pose3</a> variables).</p>
