Today we launched GTSAM's new web presence, [gtsam.org](http://gtsam.org). The site is hosted by Github Pages, and is generated via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a simple static website generator.

At the moment, the page still looks rather spartan, but we'll add a little more design features as time goes on. Plans also call for blog posts (such as this one) and tutorials, on factor graphs and on GTSAM's implementation of it.
