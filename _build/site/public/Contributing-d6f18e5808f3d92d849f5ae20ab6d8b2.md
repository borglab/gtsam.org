# Introduction
If you have improvements to GTSAM, send us your pull requests!

Our standard workflow is to fork GTSAM’s [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam) into your own GitHub account and then push your changes into a branch on your fork. Once you believe your code is ready to be merged into GTSAM’s primary repository, open a pull request via the GitHub website. Your code will then undergo an interactive review process and Continuous Integration (CI) tests before it is merged into GTSAM’s primary repository.

We use [Giflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as our branching model, as illustrated below, so most likely your branch will be either a *fix* or a *feature* branch.

GTSAM’s CI service runs on all pull requests each time they are submitted and updated. Pull requests cannot be merged into master unless all unit tests pass on all supported platform configurations.

<!-- We would like to hear about your success stories if you’ve used GTSAM in your own projects. Please consider contributing to our GTSAM Gallery by editing doc/gallery.rst and submitting a pull request with the update! -->

# Licensing

Important note: GTSAM is an open source project licensed under extremely flexible terms intended to encourage use by anyone, for any purpose. When you make a contribution to the GTSAM project, you are agreeing to do so under those same terms.

# Testing

We are strong adherents of test-driven design and debugging. When you contribute a new feature, start with a unit test that exercises the API you want to provide, and only then write the code. If you believe there is an issue with GTSAM, please try to write a minimal unit test to reproduce the behavior, then fix it. Always write the test first.

# Issue Tracking

For complex changes, especially those that will span multiple PRs, please open a GitHub issue and solicit design feedback before you invest a lot of time in code.

Be prepared to engage in active code review on your pull requests. If a reviewer asks you for more information, that is a sign you should add more documentation to your PR.

A PR generally should not include more than 750 added or changed lines (the green +### number as reported by github), and must not include more than 1500 lines of *code*.

# Coding Conventions:

For C++ we follow the [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). 

For Python we use pep8 formatting and ask that you resolve all pylint issues.

### Using GTSAM_EXPORT:

On Windows it is necessary to explicitly export all functions from the library which should be externally accessible. To do this, include the macro GTSAM_EXPORT in your class or function definition.

For example:
```
class GTSAM_EXPORT MyClass { ... };

GTSAM_EXPORT myFunction();
```
