## Install GTSAM from Arch Linux AUR

```{warning} Installing GTSAM on Arch Linux has not been tested by the GTSAM developers.
```

GTSAM is available in the Arch User Repository
([AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)) as
[`gtsam`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtsam/).

Note you can manually install the package by following the instructions on the
[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages)
or use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers) like
[`yay`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/)
(recommended for ease of install).

It is also recommended to use the
[arch4edu](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#arch4edu)
repository. They are hosting many packages related to education and research,
including robotics such as ROS. Adding a repository allows for you to install
binaries of packages, instead of compiling them from source.
This will greatly speed up your installation time. Visit [here](https://github.com/arch4edu/arch4edu/wiki/Add-arch4edu-to-your-Archlinux) to add and use arch4edu. 

### Install GTSAM
```sh
yay -S gtsam
```

or

### Install GTSAM with Intel Accelerations

```sh
yay -S gtsam-mkl
```

To discuss any issues related to this package refer to the comments section on
the AUR page of `gtsam` [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtsam/).
