    "## The problem with DLT\n",
    "\n",
    "DLT provides an exact solution to the triangulation problem in the absence of measurement noise. In practice however, the **2D measurements we use are almost always noisy**, so their back-projected rays may no longer intersect in 3D. The DLT, being an unweighted least squares solution, places equal weight on the residual from each measurement (each row of the linear system in (3)). The trouble is that this does not minimize the proper cost function. The covariance of the estimate with respect to a measurement depends on factors like the *range* of the estimate from the camera (i.e, measurements from closer cameras should be trusted more). Ideally, we should minimize the *covariance-weighted* reprojection errors on the image plane instead of the residuals of the arbitrarily scaled rows of (3). \n",

    "There are two key conclusions from these numerical experiments. First, LOST provides identical triangulation performance (i.e., identical errors) as the iterative nonlinear least squares (DLT+OPT) but at a fraction of the computational cost. There seems to be a strong case for using LOST instead of the conventional iterative methods in most situations - especially when runtime is important. Second, there are certainly some cases (such as this one) where using optimal triangulation provides substantial performance benefits when compared to the DLT.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The 3D point is at significantly different ranges from each camera that observes it. Since the covariance of the estimate increases with its range from the camera, optimal triangulation weighs measurements from closer cameras more than those from farther cameras. This can also be seen in (12): the weights of each measurement are inversely proportional to the $\\rho_i$. The optimal estimates are therefore closer to the measurements from closer cameras.\n",
    "- When different measurements have different 2D noise models. This can happen if the cameras observing these measurements are of different quality, or the measurement noise is non-uniformly distributed across the image (more on the edges and lesser at the center, for instance). \n",

    "In other cases, the results from DLT and optimal triangulation are unlikely to be very different. For highly runtime-constrained applications that encounter the above scenarios, using LOST instead of results from DLT can reduce estimation errors."
