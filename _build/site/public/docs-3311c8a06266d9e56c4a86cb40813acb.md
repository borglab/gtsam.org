# Documentation

For a hands-on mathematical introduction see the tutorial on [Factor Graphs and GTSAM](/tutorial).

## API and Wrapper Documentation

Currently, detailed API documentation is available only for C++ via the [C++ Doxygen generated site](https://gtsam.org/docs/#:~:text=C%2B%2B%20Doxygen%20generated%20site).

GTSAM comes with a python wrapper (see cython directory) and a matlab wrapper (see matlab directory), and for prototyping with GTSAM we highly recommend using one of the above. The auto-generated API documentation for python/MATLAB is limited to the number and type of input arguments, and again the [doxygen docs](https://gtsam.org/doxygen/) provide the details.
