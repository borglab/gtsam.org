[GTSAM is now live on Github](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam). Github is doing so many things right, in addition to being the go-to platform for open source: it has free continuous integration for open source projects, it supports building great web-sites, and it is itself supporting many great efforts such as VS-code and Atom. While we initially launched GTSAM on Bitbucket because of its unlimited private repos, we felt we could hold out no longer. Github, here we come :-)
