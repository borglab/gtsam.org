:::{important} GTSAM: Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping
:class: tip
GTSAM 4.1 is a BSD-licensed C++ library that implements sensor fusion for robotics and computer vision applications, including **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**, **VO (Visual Odometry)**, and **SFM (Structure from Motion)**. It uses factor graphs and Bayes networks as the underlying computing paradigm rather than sparse matrices to optimize for the most probable configuration or an optimal plan.

Coupled with a capable sensor front-end (not provided here), GTSAM powers many impressive autonomous systems, in both academia and industry.
