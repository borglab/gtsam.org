### LOST in Triangulation

***Authors:** Akshay Krishnan, Sebastien Henry, Frank Dellaert, John Christian*

This post introduces the triangulation problem and some commonly used solutions (both optimal and sub-optimal), along with GTSAM code examples. We also discuss a recently proposed linear optimal triangulation method (LOST) and compare its performance to other methods...
